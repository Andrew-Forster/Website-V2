                    The "About Me" website project undertaken during my Web Design course in 2023 marked a significant
                    milestone in my journey as a web designer. It not only provided me with practical experience in
                    designing and building functional websites but also ignited a passion for the craft that continues
                    to drive my professional growth and aspirations. Through dedication, creativity, and a commitment to
                    excellence, I have leveraged this project as a springboard for further exploration and achievement
                    in the field of web design.

                    In 2021, I embarked on a project to create a Discord bot called "Thunder GTN" that engaged
                    users in a fun guessing game. The bot challenged players to guess a randomly generated number within
                    a specified range, and also offered other games like "Higher or Lower" to keep users entertained.
                    Developed using a rudimentary TypeScript language within the Discord Bot Designer app, this project
                    served as an entry point into coding and bot development.

                    My journey into coding began with a childhood passion for Minecraft, where I immersed myself in the
                    world of block-building and exploration. As I delved deeper into the game, I became fascinated by
                    the potential of in-game commands to create intricate systems and automate tasks within Minecraft
                    realms.
                    <br><br>
                    Inspired by this newfound interest, I began experimenting with coding mcfunction files, harnessing
                    the power of commands to construct complex structures, implementing game mechanics, and facilitating
                    gameplay experiences for myself and others. This led to the creation of multiple Minecraft
                    realms, each crafted and coded to offer unique and engaging adventures for players.
                    <br><br>
                    Through these projects, I discovered my innate passion for coding, as I found joy in the process of
                    problem-solving, creative expression, and community-building. These early experiences with Minecraft
                    command projects served as a gateway to my ongoing pursuit of coding excellence, shaping my path and
                    fueling my ambition to continue learning, growing, and creating in the ever-evolving space of
                    technology.
